Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Overview

Retrieval-Augmented Generation is a technique that improves large language model responses by grounding them in external data sources. Instead of relying only on model parameters, the system retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base and provides it to the model as context.

Why RAG is Useful
RAG helps reduce hallucinations by giving the model factual context. It also enables domain-specific applications like customer support bots, internal documentation assistants, or chatbots that answer questions from uploaded documents.

How RAG Works
1. Ingest documents and convert them into text chunks.
2. Embed each chunk using an embedding model.
3. Store embeddings in a vector database.
4. Take a user question, embed it, and perform similarity search.
5. Retrieve top chunks and pass them to the language model.
6. Model generates an answer grounded in retrieved context.

Example Workflow
User Question → Vector Search → Retrieve Context → LLM Answer

This is just dummy content for testing ingestion. You can replace this later with real documents like PDFs, technical specs, notes, articles, or business data.
